# LinkedIn-automation-lead-sourcing-and-video-creation
To address the task of automating LinkedIn cold outreach, tracking KPIs, and integrating video messages as outlined in the job description, here's a Python-based approach. The solution involves LinkedIn automation, lead sourcing, and video creation using Python libraries and external tools like Dripify (or any alternative API-based tool for LinkedIn outreach).

Here's how you could implement the automation solution:
Steps:

    Lead Sourcing:
        Extract LinkedIn profile URLs using an automated scraping or API-based approach (ensure to respect LinkedIn’s terms of service).
        Store the leads (LinkedIn profiles) for further outreach.

    Connection Request:
        Automate the connection requests via Dripify or any LinkedIn API integration.

    Messaging:
        Send standard message and follow-up using Dripify or a similar tool.

    Video Pitch:
        Create a video with a fixed message and include the lead's website screenshot as an image overlay.

    Tracking KPIs:
        Track sent requests, messages, responses, and analyze conversion rates to identify weak points.

Prerequisites:

    LinkedIn API/Dripify API for automating connections and messages.
    Python Libraries: requests, pandas, openCV, ffmpeg, and possibly Selenium for web automation.
    External Tools: Dripify, LinkedIn Scraper (or any LinkedIn scraping library like linkedin-api), and a video creation library like moviepy for creating video messages.

Python Code Example:

import requests
import pandas as pd
import time
import random
import os
import cv2
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, TextClip, concatenate_videoclips
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

# Part 1: Lead Sourcing
def get_linkedin_profiles(search_query):
    """Simulating lead sourcing with LinkedIn search query."""
    # This is an example and would require LinkedIn scraping API or a service like Dripify or LinkedIn API

    # Example: searching LinkedIn profiles for managing directors of eCommerce businesses
    search_url = f"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords={search_query}&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER"
    
    # Ideally, use API/Tools like LinkedIn API to automate this or browser automation.
    # This can be done using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or a LinkedIn API tool to scrape profiles.

    # For simulation, let's assume this list of leads (replace with real scraping or API).

    cv2.imwrite(screenshot_path, img)
    
    # Create video with a fixed message (you need to prepare a base video beforehand)
    base_video = VideoFileClip('my_video.mp4')  # Your video with a fixed message (circle image on bottom left)
    
    # Add text overlay or a circle with the screenshot (for demonstration)
    txt_clip = TextClip(f"Website: {website_url}", fontsize=24, color='white')

Explanation of Code:

    Lead Sourcing: The get_linkedin_profiles() function simulates scraping LinkedIn for leads using a search query. This would ideally use an API or a scraping tool like Selenium to gather real LinkedIn profile links.

    Sending Connection Requests: The send_connection_request() function simulates sending a connection request via Dripify API. You would replace this with actual API calls or use Selenium to automate this in a browser.

    Automated Messaging: The send_message() function sends a follow-up message once the connection is accepted. This can be enhanced further using tools like Dripify.

    Video Message Creation: The create_video_message() function automates the creation of video messages, where a video file (fixed video
